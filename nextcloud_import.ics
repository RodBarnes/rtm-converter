DESCRIPTION:2025-12-18\nI looked at it (fresh 0.1.55) and it shows promise:\n1) It doesn't automatically recognize bash language.  It does if the file is a .sh.  This case (https://github.com/sinelaw/fresh/issues/383#event-21655849895) apparently addresses this issue.\n2) The colors aren't great but maybe I just don't know enough yet.\n3) Copy/paste appears to work correctly.\n4) It is written in rust vs micro being written in golang.

This might be valuable installed on the servers.\nhttps://github.com/9001/copyparty\n\nWireGuard VPN with TLS Tunneling\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwYIrpOr1j0\n\nThis is worth reviewing to see understand the tunneling should I get to a public connection that doesn't allow passing only UDP packets as is done with Wireguard.

DESCRIPTION:The router supports DNS under the VPN Server.  Is this just saying to use the router instead of some other server\; e.g.\, google at 8.8.8.8?  Or is there a way to add entries for devices behind the VPN in the home network.\n\nCurrently\, I am using DHCP reservations (for all computers and the printer) and entering names with those ip addresses in hosts.  I'd like to not have to do this.  I'd like to just be able to reference the name and have it figure out the IP in the background through some service or whatever.

DESCRIPTION:It can do multiple (unlimited?) levels of subtasks. It has notes.  It has tags but does not have lists.  It has priority (9-6 low\, 5 medium\, 4-1 high\, 0 no priority).  It has field for setting percent complete.\n\nRepeating tasks are not supported in the web interface but they are supported in the backend and Tasks.org supports creating these.\n\nTasks also appear as a pane in the calendar (collapsible).  The "visibility of smart collections" can be set -- not sure what this is.\n\nThere is no direct handler to import exported RTM tasks into Tasks.org.  RTM produces a JSON iCal (.ics) file.  Tasks.org doesn't understand this but can accept a CSV.  Some kind of conversion program would be needed.\n\nI installed the Tasks.org app on phone\, created a test task (with multiple sub-tasks four deep)\, and set up DAVx to sync tasks.  It is working.  Need to play with it to see.

I think it is set up correctly\, I just need to do some failed login testing to confirm.\n\nWatch the logs via "sudo tail -f /var/lib/docker/volumes/nextcloud_aio_nextcloud/_data/data/nextcloud.log".  This is the path which fail2ban is watching.  It is the file system exposed logs which are the same ones viewed within the container via "tail -f /var/www/html/data/nextcloud.log"\n\nMake several failed logins.  Nextcloud will display a "Too many attempts" after about 6-10 failures.  It  may take 5 or as many as 30 minutes to clear.\n\nBut it can be forced.

DESCRIPTION:I downloaded the photos from 2025 PNWGT and 2025 Ride Photos then uploaded all of these to the /Photos folder.  When I attempt to add photos to a folder\, there are two that do not appear.  If I select "Photos" and scroll to the bottom\, I see two photos under the January 2025 heading.  Yet\, when I go to "Albums"\, create and album\, and "Add photos"\, then scroll tot he bottom\, those pictures do not appear.  The list ends with the March 2025 photos.\n\nI submitted a bug: https://github.com/nextcloud/photos/issues/3365\n\nNot very pleased.  It does provide an album but it is really basic.  You can create albums and collaborative (shared?) albums but cannot organize the photos in the album\; i.e.\, they are listed only in date order.  That sort order is pointless and arbitrary.

DESCRIPTION:There isn't enough space gained (~100MB) by removing unnecessary packages to make it worth doing.  I have both recovery partitions set to 5GB and that is not worth worrying about.\n\nI asked Grok "If I were to remove all the package listed on this page (https://wiki.debian.org/ReduceDebian#Remove_non-critical_packages) from a standard Debian install (which has no GUI installed and no web server)\, can you determine how much total space would be saved?"\n\nHe replied: "The space saved by removing the non-critical packages identified via the command in the wiki's "Remove non-critical packages" section (after also running the subsequent apt-get purge aptitude\, apt-get autoremove\, and apt-get clean steps) would be approximately 100 MB on a fresh minimal Debian 12 server installation. This estimate is based on comparisons of disk usage in equivalent setups before and after similar optimizations\, assuming an amd64 architecture. Note that exact savings can vary slightly depending on the specific Debian version\, architecture\, and any dependencies that get autoremoved."\n\nDoing `df -H` it shows that the recovery partition (/deb/sda4) is 8.2G of which only 1.4G is used.
